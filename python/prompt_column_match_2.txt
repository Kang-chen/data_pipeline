#### Task Description ####: The task is to match a list of single cell metadata column outputs with a list of target data columns. The target columns are predefined as ['dataset_id', 'assay', 'cell_type_original', 'development_stage_original', 'disease_original', 'donor_id', 'sex', 'tissue_original', 'is_primary']. The goal is to find a one-to-one match between the input and target columns.\n\n #### Example:#### Given the following input columns: input_column = ['orig.ident', 'nCount_RNA', 'nFeature_RNA', 'n_genes', 'n_genes_by_counts', 'total_counts', 'total_counts_mt', 'pct_counts_mt', 'doublet_scores', 'predicted_doublets','celltype'] And the target columns: target_columns = ['dataset_id', 'assay',  'cell_type_original', 'development_stage_original', 'disease_original',  'donor_id', 'sex',  'tissue_original', 'is_primary']\n The output should be a dictionary where each key is a target column and the value is the corresponding match from the input columns or None if no match is found. example_output = "Match results: \n dataset_id -> None \n assay -> None\n cell_type_original -> 'celltype'\n development_stage -> None \n disease_original -> None \n disease_ontology -> None \n donor_id -> orig.ident \n sex -> None \n tissue_original -> None \n is_primary -> None" \n notes = "The output should start with 'Match results' and each line should represent a match.\n If a match is found, it must be one-to-one and please do not change name of input variable.\n The output should only include the columns in 'Match results', no additional analysis is needed. \n The left side of the match must be an element from the target columns. \n The target columns are predefined and must appear on the key of the dictionary." \n #### Now suppose there is a new input_columns, please output as follows: ####  "Match results: \n dataset_id -> xx (your match, some thing in the new input or None) \n assay -> \n cell_type_original -> \n development_stage_original -> \n disease_original ->  \n donor_id -> \n sex -> \n tissue_original -> \n is_primary ->" new input is as follows: Variable:
